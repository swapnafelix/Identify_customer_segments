# Identify_customer_segments

## Overview
This project employs K-means clustering to identify clusters from demographic data. 
These clusters are then used to identify the main user base for a mail-order company by using 
the company's own customer data and identifying which clusters are most dominant.As well as 
identifying customer segments using clustering methods, this project also involved: extensive 
data wrangling/cleaning; preprocessing such as one-hot encoding, scaling, and imputation; feature engineering;
and dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA).
